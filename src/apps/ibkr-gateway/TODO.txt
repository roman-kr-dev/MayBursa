2. Enhance Authentication Status Service

  - Add missing endpoint usage:
    - /iserver/auth/ssodh/init for SSO initialization
    - /sso/validate for SSO validation

  - Improve session validation logic with more comprehensive checks
  - Add session expiry tracking
  - Implement better competing session handling

  3. Improve Gateway Monitor Service

  - Add progressive backoff for authentication retries
  - Implement health check endpoint monitoring
  - Add memory/CPU usage tracking for the gateway process
  - Improve crash detection and recovery logic
  - Add configurable monitoring intervals

  4. Enhance Connection Status Service

  - Add more comprehensive API endpoint checks
  - Implement connection quality metrics
  - Add network latency tracking over time
  - Improve retry logic with circuit breaker pattern (✅ Already done via apiClient)

  5. Session Management Improvements

  - Implement proper session keep-alive using /tickle endpoint (✅ Already available via
  apiClient)
  - Add session refresh logic before expiry
  - Track session duration and warn before timeout
  - Add automatic session renewal

  6. Error Handling Enhancements

  - Add specific error types for different failure scenarios (✅ Partially done in
  apiClient)
  - Implement error recovery strategies
  - Add detailed error logging with context
  - Create error notification system

  7. Process Management Improvements

  - Add graceful shutdown handling
  - Implement process health metrics
  - Add memory leak detection
  - Improve PID file management

  8. Configuration Enhancements

  - Add more configuration options:
    - Session timeout settings
    - Retry configuration
    - Monitoring intervals
    - Health check thresholds

  9. Additional API Endpoints

  Based on the API documentation, consider adding methods for:
  - Account management endpoints
  - Trading endpoints (orders, positions)
  - Market data endpoints
  - Portfolio analysis endpoints

  10. Observability & Monitoring

  - Add structured logging with correlation IDs
  - Implement metrics dashboard
  - Add performance profiling
  - Create alerting system for critical failures

  Would you like me to prioritize and create a detailed implementation plan for any of
  these improvements?
